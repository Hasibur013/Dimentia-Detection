DEMENTIA DATASET ANALYSIS SUMMARY
======================================

1. Dataset Overview:
- Total Records: 809
- Total Features (after cleaning): 13
- Numeric Features: 11
- Categorical Features: 2
- Missing Values Handled: Yes
- Duplicate Rows Found: 0

2. Target Variable ('Group'):
- Final Classes: ['Nondemented', 'Demented']
- Distribution: {'Nondemented': 626, 'Demented': 183}
- Imbalance: The dataset is imbalanced, with more 'Nondemented' cases. This justifies using SMOTE in the modeling phase.

3. Key Findings from Correlation Analysis:
- Most positively correlated with dementia: 'nWBV' (Corr: 0.41)
- Most negatively correlated with dementia: 'CDR' (Corr: -0.57)

4. Key Findings from Feature Importance (Mutual Information):
- Most important feature: 'CDR' (MI Score: 0.209)
- Second most important feature: 'nWBV' (MI Score: 0.128)

5. Dimensionality and Outliers:
- PCA: 8 components are needed to explain 95% of the variance.
- Outliers: Outliers were detected, particularly in 'SES'. Tree-based models will be robust to this.

6. Preprocessing Recommendations for Modeling:
- Scaling: StandardScaler will be applied to numeric features.
- Encoding: OneHotEncoder will be applied to categorical features.
- Imbalance: SMOTE will be used to balance the training data.
- Feature Selection: All features will be retained initially, as ensemble models can handle feature importance internally.
